# Background and context:
Education has recently joined the global call to action to mitigate the impact of the
environmental crisis. As students at Fulford school we want to be part of the answer.
Developing sustainable scalable solutions which educate innovate and inspire the next
generation to be self-sustaining.

# Problem:
The move to cloud computing has been instrumental in reducing the carbon footprint of
organisations and supporting the work towards net zero. The challenge facing smaller
organisations /educational institutions is the prohibitive cost of replacing on premise
solutions in an achievable way.

# Our problem statement:
How can small organisations proactively react to become instrumental in the solution to
sustainability and lowering energy costs whilst continuing to operate an on-premise
solution.

# Solution
Our solution is to create a sustainable source of heat that allows companies to
simultaneously save money and help the environment. Our concept looks to wrap a
water-cooling system around on premise servers to absorb the heat. This hot water could then be used to transfer the energy into buildings via their central heating system.
The cooled water can then be recycled back into the server rooms completing the cycle
This has exponential possibilities as we can even extract energy using latent heat if we
need to do so in the future. Reducing environmental impact and creating an eco-system
that becomes self-sustaining.
